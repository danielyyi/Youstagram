# Youstagram
## (CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT)

Youstagram is a mock Instagram (as the name suggests) and is designed to give the user more customization over their posts and profiles. Users will be able to add colors to areas surrounding their pictures, as well as change the outer border shape of their posts. They will also be able to customize the colors, fonts, and shapes of their profile page. 

This project will grow my proficiency in Javascript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Apollo and GraphQL, and AWS web services (basically the MERN stack + GraphQL + AWS). The main idea is to use the MERN stack to add CRUD functionality with GraphQL being a middle man before MondoDB (easier to work with in this case). AWS will act as a secondary database to store images and provide image links which will be stored in MongoDB (since Mongo is not good with storing images). The main challenge will be to integrate all these frameworks and libraries in an efficient, but more importantly, working manner.
